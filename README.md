# News Comment Analyzer

This project brings in comments from news articles, groups what they cover, analyzes bias, analyzes aggression, and then clusters to help you properly accept certain news articles and public reactions.

The GPT API has been actively utilized to improve the accuracy of natural language processing and allows users to access analysis results more actively and easily.

In addition, the clustering process analyzes comments, article content, and trends to find other news articles and provides a variety of insights so that they are not biased toward only one opinion.
